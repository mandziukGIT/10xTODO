### Guidelines for NUXT


#### NUXT

- Leverage auto-imports for Vue and Nuxt composables to reduce boilerplate
- Implement server routes with the server directory for API functionality
- Use Nuxt modules for extending functionality instead of custom plugins when possible
- Leverage the useAsyncData and useFetch composables for data fetching with SSR support
- Implement middleware (defineNuxtRouteMiddleware) for navigation guards
- Use Nuxt layouts for consistent page layouts across routes
- Leverage Nitro for server-side rendering and API routes
- Implement Nuxt plugins for global functionality registration
- Use state management with useState for simple state or Pinia for complex applications
